# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Round 1, Day 1: 28 November 2018

**Today's Progress**:
  * Forked original 100-days-of-code repository and created new repo not linked to the original so that my work shows up on GitHub's activity chart.
  * Started to implement the [Auto-Expanding Textarea](https://codepen.io/VAggrippino/pen/YRaeya) for [donot-link-this](https://github.com/VAggrippino/donot-link-this)

**Thoughts:**
  * My alternate version of 100 Days Of Code should be a good thing for me, but we'll see if anyone gets upset.
  * The autoExpand code is triggering too early. I can't figure why right now. It should only trigger a change when the height of the `textarea` content changes

**Links to work:**

  * (not committing broken code to donot-link-this)
