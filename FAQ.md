  **Q:** I've already started the challenge, and I'm currently on Day 8. How can I start using this repo to track my progress?  
  **A:** Don't worry. Enter as much information about the previous days as you can, but if you can't then just continue from where you are right now. If you have been tweeting about your progress every day, put the links to your tweets in the Log for each day. Then, follow the format.  

  **Q:** I am new to coding (or just deciding to learn to code) and can’t build projects yet, what should I do?  
  **A:** Work on real projects whenever you can. When you can't, work on tutorials and practice projects until you're able to work on real projects.

  **Q:** I’ve missed a day, does it mean I’ve failed the challenge?  
  **A:** Absolutely not. Life happens. Your goal is to continually move forward and improve yourself. If you missed a day because you wanted to play the latest game on Steam for 20 hours straight, you failed the challenge. If you missed a week because your mother went in the hospital, you're still in. Ultimately, this is your challenge and you're the only one who can decide when you've failed.
  
  **Q:** I come home late, and by the time I am finished with my hour, it’s past midnight, does it count?  
  **A:** Of course it counts! You define your day by your schedule. Don’t do yourself a disservice by measuring your efforts to a clock.  

  **Q:** Should I keep a journal?  
  **A:** Yes you should, and the best way to do that is to fork this repo, and commit to [the Log](log.md) daily. It’s helpful in two major ways: you will be able to look at the progress each day and see how far you’ve already come and it will be easier to find the motivation to continue, and the second one is that after you’ve done your 100 days, you will be able to analyze your experience better and see what worked and what didn’t.

  **Q:** Should I put my projects online?  
  **A:** Definitely. It’s great for accountability and motivation to know that the stuff you’ve worked on is accessible online to anyone who may wish to look at it. It will make you care about the end product more, and will lead to a more impressive result in the end. I suggest you put them on GitHub. Later, when you're looking for a job, prospective employers will need to see examples of your work.

  **Q:** Should I worry about streaks?  
  **A:** If you like pretty green lines, use a drawing program. Streaks can be nice when showing off to others, but ultimately you're only accountable to yourself.

  **Q:** What is the most difficult part of this challenge?  
  **A:** The part where you have to sit down and start coding. Don’t postpone that or think about it at all, because you will rationalize yourself out of it. Approach it mechanically: sit down, open your laptop, launch your coding editor, and start typing. You will often experience problems / procrastination / a desire to stop. Everyone does. Keep going anyway.

  **Q:** If everyone started on a certain day, should I join them on the day they are? For example, from Day 12?  
  **A:** This challenge is individual, so when you join you start at day 1. Whenever you’ll be posting an update on Twitter or elsewhere, make sure to mention which day you are on and use the hashtag so that people can find and support you!
